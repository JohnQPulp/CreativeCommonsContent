<h1 id='bloghead' class='center'>Contacting John Q. Pulp</h1>

<p>You can reach out to me in two ways:</p>

<h2>Github</h2>

<p>If you want to leave a public comment, you can open an issue on one of the site's Github repos.</p>

<p>For general things like website code issues or new book suggestions, use the site's main repository: <a href='https://github.com/JohnQPulp/PublicDomainPulp'>https://github.com/JohnQPulp/PublicDomainPulp</a>. Whereas if you a book-specific comment or suggestion about one of the existing VNs, you can leave the issue on that specific VN's repo (e.g., <a href='https://github.com/JohnQPulp/PuddnheadWilson'>https://github.com/JohnQPulp/PuddnheadWilson</a> for <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i>).</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>If you want to leave a private comment, you can email me at <a id='email'>lol no javascript</a>.</p>

<script>
// An ultimately futile attempt against the smarter LLMs, but I'd rather those than the dumb ones.
let email = "m,o,c,.,p,l,u,p,n,i,a,m,o,d,c,i,l,b,u,p,@,p,l,u,p".split(',').reverse().join('');
document.getElementById('email').outerHTML = `<a href='mailto:${email}'>${email}</a>`;
</script>
