<p>Yesterday I published the <a href='/vn/PuddnheadWilson'>visual novel for Mark Twain's <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i></a>:</p>

<img alt="Pudd'nhead Wilson VN preview" src="/vn/PuddnheadWilson/images/preview.webp" />

<p>The book is of course entertaining and funny — that goes without saying for Twain — but in addition, it also has cool <a href="https://twain.lib.virginia.edu/wilson/facsimile/facsimilehp.html">first-edition illustrations</a>.</p>

<p>For my initial reading, I had to stick with the boring, pictureless <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/puddnhead-wilson">Standard Ebooks copy of the novel</a>, but once I started on the actual VN-editing process, I incorporated many of the original illustrations into the visual novel. All as part of marking sure that you, dear reader, will never need to suffer the pictureless reading experience.</p>

<p>But really, Twain's novels are already a treasure trove for fun drawings, with one novel in particular holding a special place for this site. You see, my profile picture on Github is this guy:</p>

<img alt="Github Profile picture" src="/images/mark-1.webp" />

<p>Which comes from Twain's funniest novel, <book>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</book>:</p>

<img alt="Book illustration" src="/images/mark-2.webp" />

<p>(For higher quality images of the drawings, see <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/86/86-h/86-h.htm">Project Gutenberg's scan of the book</a>.)</p>

<p>The relevance to the website is that it's specifically the illustrations from <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> that I use as the reference art for the VN image generations. As of writing, it's these two drawings in particular:</p>

<img alt="Character example" src="/images/mark-3.webp" />

<img alt="Background example" src="/images/mark-4.webp" />

<p>These are the character sprite reference and background picture reference that I include when making the AI drawing requests. It's these two images (combined with some long boilerplate prompting) that the whole website's art style derives from. The Mark Twain public domain style.</p>

<p>So Twain's contributions to the site are no great exaggeration. Which is why last month, I was happy to have the chance to stop over at the Mark Twain museum in Hannibal, Missouri:</p>

<img alt="Twain Museum" src="/images/mark-5.webp" />

<p>There I saw, among other things, Twain's appropriately grand bust:</p>

<img alt="Twain statue" src="/images/mark-6.webp" />

<p>And of course plenty of <book>Tom Sawyer</book> and <book>Huckleberry Finn</book> displays; and to a lesser extent, books like <book>Prince and the Pauper</book> and <book>Joan of Arc</book> too. But it was <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> I was most after.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for me, capricious Fortuna decided to rope off that one section in particular:</p>

<img alt="Connecticut Yankee closed" src="/images/mark-7.webp" />

<img alt="Connecticut Yankee still closed" src="/images/mark-8.webp" />

<p>But she didn't get the last laugh. For deeper into the museum, far back in a hall on the upper floor, back behind a display of Normal Rockwell illustrations (who knew he did Twain art too!), back where the lights flickered and hardly a fellow tourist could be found; back there is where I found the real gem of the museum: the 137-year-old <i>original</i> original illustrations for <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>!</p>

<img alt="Connecticut Yankee originals" src="/images/mark-9.webp" />

<img alt="More Connecticut Yankee originals" src="/images/mark-10.webp" />

<p>And so now you see, that when the visual novel revolution inevitably supplants all other forms of entertainment, it will be from standing on the shoulders of Mark Twain and this little glass display of his.</p>

<p>(Uh, and the illustrator I suppose.)</p>
