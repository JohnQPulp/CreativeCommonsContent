<p>Yesterday I published the <a href='/vn/PuddnheadWilson'>visual novel for Mark Twain's <i>Pudd'nhead Wilson</i></a>:</p>

<p>That it's an entertaining and funny read goes without saying for Twain. But in addition to that, it also has interesting <a href="https://twain.lib.virginia.edu/wilson/facsimile/facsimilehp.html">interesting first-edition illustrations</a>, now all public domain. I wasn't aware of them at first, since I was reading the boring, pictureless <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/mark-twain/puddnhead-wilson">Standard Ebooks copy of the novel</a>, but I found that other site after starting the research for the book, which led to incorporating many of the original drawings into the VN.</p>

<p>But really, that an illustrated edition of the book existed shouldn't have surprised me. Twain novels are a treasure trove for original illustrations, with one of his illustrated novels in particular holding a special place for the site. You see, my profile picture on Github is this drawing:</p>

<p>Which comes from Twain's funniest novel, <book>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</book>:</p>

<p>More specifically, I pulled the profile from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/86/86-h/86-h.htm">the Project Gutenberg high-quality scan of the illustrated edition of the book</a>. And from that same book, I also pulled a couple more pictures:</p>

<img alt="Background example" src="/images/mark-4.webp" />

<p>These pictures are the character sprite reference and background picture reference I use when doing the image generations for this visual novels (alongside a big boilerplate prompt). In a future post I'll run through my full process for creating the visual novels from start-to-end, but at least as far as the visuals go, it's these two images that the VNs' art style is based on — the public domain art of Twain's writings.</p>

<p>And last month, while driving home for Christmas, I had the chance to stop over at the Mark Twain museum in Hannibal, Missouri:</p>

<p>In a cruel twist of fate, all of exhibits were open <i>except</i> the one for <i>Connecticut Yankee</i>, which was roped off for fresh paint:</p>

<img alt="Connecticut Yankee closed" src="/images/mark-7.webp" />

<img alt="Connecticut Yankee still closed" src="/images/mark-8.webp" />

<p>Well, kind of roped off. I could still squint over at the plaques.</p>

<p>And in any case, it was further back in the museum, on the upper floor, that I found what I was really after — the <i>original</i> originals for the illustrations of the book!</p>

<p>From these great illustrations, made over 130 years ago, we have the basis for the visual novelization revolution all public domain literature. Though ironically, <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> itself will be one of the hardest VNs to make, since it will have to live up to the greatness of its original.</p>
