<p>This will be the first in a series of posts explaining my processes for how I convert books into visual novels.</p>

<p>The post date above represents the publication date of this entry's first draft, but I intend the posts of this series to all be living documents, continually updated over time as I figure out better and more efficient techniques, both on the manual and automation side of things.</p>

<p>For this first entry, I'll go into not the processes themselves, but the prerequisite for understanding them: the <code>pulp.txt</code> file, the "code" underlying each visual novel.</p>

<img alt="Example Visual Novel Github repo" src="/images/github.webp" />

<p>Each visual novel repo contains a <code>pulp.txt</code> file and a <code>book.txt</code> file, which are together consumed by the <a href="https://github.com/JohnQPulp/Pulpifier">Pulpifier</a> in order to build the VN-formatted html output.</p>

<p>The <code>book.txt</code> is essentially just the original text of the book, the output of pandoc-converting a Standard Ebooks .epub into a .txt file. (Using the <code>gfm-raw_html</code> target format, along with some other flags, and also some manual cleanup, that I'll all describe in more detail in the next part.)</p>

<p>Here's a <code>book.txt</code> example snippet:</p>

<pre>
### VII

As I started up the stairs the concierge knocked on the glass of the door of her lodge, and as I stopped she came out. She had some letters and a telegram.

“Here is the post. And there was a lady here to see you.”

“Did she leave a card?”

“No. She was with a gentleman. It was the one who was here last night. In the end I find she is very nice.”

“Was she with a friend of mine?”

“I don’t know. He was never here before. He was very large. Very, very large. She was very nice. Very, very nice. Last night she was, perhaps, a little﻿—” She put her head on one hand and rocked it up and down. “I’ll speak perfectly frankly, Monsieur Barnes. Last night I found her not so *gentille*. Last night I formed another idea of her. But listen to what I tell you. She is *très, très gentille*. She is of very good family. It is a thing you can see.”

“They did not leave any word?”

“Yes. They said they would be back in an hour.”

“Send them up when they come.”

“Yes, Monsieur Barnes. And that lady, that lady there is someone. An eccentric, perhaps, but *quelqu’une, quelqu’une*!”
</pre>

<p>The main features to note are that:</p>

<ul>
<li>The file alternates between text lines and blank lines.</li>
<li>Each text line represents one paragraph.</li>
<li>Raw markdown symbols are included, such as <code>*italics*</code> and <code>## Headings</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>book.txt</code> file is the reference file — the source of truth that the Pulpifier compares the <code>pulp.txt</code> file against. The corresponding <code>pulp.txt</code> snippet for this chunk is:</p>

</pre>

<p>Note how the <code>pulp.txt</code> file:</p>

<ul>
<li>Alternates text line, metadata line, blank line; repeat. So a 3-cycle instead of <code>book.txt</code>'s 2-cycle.</li>
<li>Contains the exact<a href="#quote-handling">*</a> same text content, including the same markdown, as <code>book.txt</code>. (One of the functions of the Pulpifier is to check the combined text contents of <code>pulp.txt</code> against <code>book.txt</code> to make sure no transcription or editing mistakes accidentally changed the original text.)</li>
<li>Contains more lines than the original <code>book.txt</code>, despite containing the same overall text. For while <code>book.txt</code>'s lines represent whole paragraphs, <code>pulp.txt</code>'s lines represent individual slides of the visual novel. Thus, for visual presentation purposes, we want long paragraphs split up.</li>
</ul>

<p>The text lines and their associated metadata define all aspects of the visual novel's presentation. In this case, one example slide looks like this:</p>

<img alt="Visual novel example slide" src="/images/slide.webp" />

<p>This fifth line of the example snippet can be explained as a combination of the text of that particular line along with its line metadata and the 4 lines of metadata before it. Walking through this specific example will help give a high-level overview of how the <code>pulp.txt</code> format with its metadata tags works, before going into the specific documentation of each tag.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first line's <code>r=title</code> uses the (r)eset tag to reset most metadata to its default state. This is important because certain metadata carries over from line-to-line, and so you'll usually see the resets at the beginning of each chapter, as those act as clear refresh points. The <code>=title</code> part is the tag telling the VN to use the title-card background for the chapter header line.</li>
<li>The second line's <code>b=flat-concierge-int</code> uses the (b)ackground tag to set the VN to the interior flat lobby background. (r)eset and (b)ackground both set a background, but (b)ackground only sets the background — it doesn't affect any other metadata. Either way, once the background has been set, it stays with that background until changed again. So since none of the subsequent lines change the background, it's that same background that the 5th line will end up using.</li>
<li>The third line's <code>n:concierge1=Concierge;c=concierge1;e:concierge1=happy</code> uses three new tags (separated by semicolons, which act as the tags' dividors) to do the following things:
<ul>
<li><code>n:concierge1=Concierge</code> uses the (n)ame tag to define a new character with the ID <code>concierge1</code> with the user-displayed name of "Conierge".</li>
<li><code>c=concierge</code> uses the (c)haracter tag to set <code>concierge1</code> as the on-screen character.</li>
<li><code>e:concierge1=happy</code> uses the (e)xpression tag to set <code>concierge1</code>'s state to <code>happy</code>, such that while on-screen, her appearance will use her "happy" sprite set.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>s=concierge1</code> uses the (s)peaker tag to set the speaker to <code>concierge1</code>. During this line, her name will appear on-screen as the speaker and her character will use a speaking sprite (<code>c-concierge-ehappy-s.webp</code>, taking into account the previous line).</li>
<li><code>s=jake</code> updates the speaker to <code>jake</code>, a character defined in a previous chapter (who therefore doesn't need to be redefined). Since his character isn't on-screen, he'll appear in the lower-left corner "speaker box", where he can be seen in his neutral speaking expression, since no specific expression was set.</li>
</ul>

<p>All together, you can see how the relatively simple metadata annotations of the <code>pulp.txt</code> file can fully control the appearance of the book's visual novel.</p>

<p>And simplicity is the main goal of the format: text files are simple to read, simple to edit, simple to commit and diff, and simple to <i>generate</i>. (In subsequent parts, I'll discuss the role of LLMs in visual novel creation.)</p>

<p>So jumping off from this example, let's go through each <code>pulp.txt</code> metadata tag in detail:</p>

<h1>The Metadata Tag Lines</h1>

<p>The overall format for the metadata tags is <code>k=value</code> or <code>k:name=value</code> or <code>k=val1,val2,…,valN</code> or <code>k:name=val1,val2,…,valN</code>.</p>

<p><code>k</code> is the tag key, a single-letter identifier for which tag is being set e.g., <code>b</code> for background or <code>c</code> for characters. Some tags like background accept a single value argument (you can only set one background at-a-time), whereas others like characters can accept one or many or even zero (e.g., <code>c=belmonte,romero,marcial</code> sets three characters to be on-screen at once).</p>

<p>Some tags like <code>e</code> (expression) take a required <code>name</code> parameter as the first argument, written like <code>e:romero=happy</code>. These name-requiring parameters tags can also set multiple values, like the <code>z</code> (zoom) tag for setting character sprite positioning metadata e.g., <code>z:hubertfather=94,49,3</code>. Functionally, there isn't really difference between the name-requiring and non-name-requiring tags except insofar as how they're written. Theoretically the format could instead be <code>e=romero,happy</code> and <code>z=hubertfather,94,49,3</code>, and they'd still just be tags accepting arguments like the others, but having the names be a visually distinct first parameter helps improve readability.</p>

<p>Metadata lines are made up of sets of metadata tags, ranging from zero to many per line, separated by semicolons. A valid metadata line might be completely blank, or it might have lots of delimited tags like:</p>

<pre>s=bill;e:bill=;c=bill;v=100,115;z:bill=103</pre>

<p>The tags are read left-to-right, and processed in that order, so if for whatever reason a metadata line sets the same tag twice like <code>s=bill;s=jake</code>, it's the second value that wins out. (Though there isn't any reason to do this in practice, and I might change it to just be a parsing error later on.)</p>

<p>Now let's go through all the individual tags and explain how they work and how they relate to each other and the text lines:</p>

<h2>(b)ackground</h2>

<p><code>b</code> accepts exactly one argument, setting the background like <code>b=flat-ext</code>. This presumes the existance of a background image file named <code>b-flat-ext.webp</code>.</p>

<p>The set background will remain the active background until changed by a subsequent <code>b</code> or <code>r</code> tag.</p>

<h2>(n)ame</h2>

<p><code>n</code> accepts two arguments, a character identifier and a display name e.g., <code>n:mike=Michael Campbell</code>. This acts as the declaration of a new character, allowing the identifier to be used in subsequent tags. (Which otherwise throw undeclared identifier errors.)</p>

<p>An identifier cannot be undeclared, but the display name can be changed over time, if for example a character's name is revealed in stages. You might have the display start off as <code>n:jake=?</code> for an unnamed character, then switch to <code>n:jake=Jake</code> once you learn their first name, and then finally <code>n:jake=Jake Barnes</code>.</p>

<h2>(c)haracters</h2>

<p><code>c</code> accepts zero-to-five arguments, establishing which all characters are on-screen, using previously declared character identifiers. If for example you set <code>c=jake</code>, then the VN will display the <code>c-jake.webp</code> sprite centered horizontally on top of the background.</p>

<p>Providing zero arguments like <code>c=</code> removes all on-screen characters.</p>

<p>Providing more than one argument like <code>c=jake,brett</code> positions characters using a slot system where, given N arguments, the character in slot X is positioned at X/(N+1) of the way horizontally on the screen. In this case, <code>jake</code> in slot 1 is positioned at the 1/3 horizontal position, and <code>brett</code> in slot 2 is set at the 2/3 position. With five slots, any fractional position up to denominator of 6 is allowed. It's even possible to leave slots empty like <code>c=,,brett</code>, which puts <code>brett</code> at the 3/4 position, leaving the 1/4 and 2/4 positions unfilled. In this way, along with the <code>v</code> tag, the positioning of on-screen characters can be controlled.</p>

<h2>(o)bject</h2>

<p><code>o</code> accepts zero or one arguments, placing an object sprite on screen like <code>o=trout</code> for <code>o-trout.webp</code>. Unlike backgrounds, objects don't cover the whole screen, but sit, horizontally centered, on top of both the background and characters. Like with backgrounds, they stay on-screen until another <code>o</code> tag is set, either switching to a different object, or removing any object via <code>o=</code>.</p>

<h2>(e)xpression</h2>

<p><code>e</code> accepts a required <code>name</code> argument (a previously declared character identifier) and an expression/emotion string e.g., <code>e:jake=happy</code>. This tells the VN to use the <code>c-jake-ehappy.webp</code> sprite when that character is on-screen. The expression state remains active on that character until changed.</p>

<p>A character can be reset to their neutral state (e.g., <code>c-jake.webp</code>) by setting either <code>e:jake=</code> with no value or <code>e:jake=neutral</code> using the special <code>neutral</code> keyword value.</p>

<h2>(a)ge</h2>

<p><code>a</code> works similarly to <code>e</code>, but acts as another dimension by which to set character traits. Also accepting an identifier and string like <code>a:robert=old</code>, this instructs the VN to use image files like <code>c-robert-aold.webp</code>; or, when combined with an active expression, like <code>c-robert-aold-eweary.webp</code>. (It can also be reset by setting <code>a:robert=</code>.)</p>

<h2>e(x)tras</h2>

<p><code>x</code> works similarly to <code>e</code> and <code>a</code>, acting as a third dimension by which to set character traits. It accepts an identifier and zero or more extra modifiers like <code>x:belmonte=longjaw,capeless</code>, instructing the VN to use the sprite <code>c-belmonte-xcapeless-xlongjaw.webp</code> (note the alphabet sorting for different extra attributes). It combines with the other two above tags to form full sprite names like <code>c-belmonte-aold-xcapeless-xlongjaw-eserious.webp</code>. (<code>x</code> can also be reset by setting <code>x:belmonte=</code>.)</p>

<h2>(s)peaker</h2>

<p><code>s</code> accepts zero or one argument, defining the active speaker like <code>s=jake</code> if ther is one, or setting the speaker to no one like <code>s=</code> or <code>s=none</code>.</p>

<p>When a character is speaking, they'll appear on-screen. Where they appear depends on if they're already on-screen as a <code>c</code> tag argument. If they are already part of that set of on-screen characters, they'll appear speaking as they are, whichever slot <code>c</code> has positioned them in. If they aren't already on-screen though, they'll appear in the lower-left corner speaker box.</p>

<p>When a character is speaking, their associated image file will have a suffix like <code>-s</code> or <code>-s2</code> or <code>-s3</code>. This combines with the above three tags to form full file names like <code>c-belmonte-aold-xcapeless-xlongjaw-eserious-s.webp</code>. As you can see, these files can get quite long all put together, which is why it's useful to have these four tags all settable separately, and leave the actual specific file name construction to the Pulpifier, rather than having to set a full file name for each sprite update to any of the character characteristics.</p>

<p>The <code>-s</code>, <code>-s2</code>, and <code>-s3</code> thing is from a feature of the Pulpifier whereby if a character speaks for multiple lines without changing their expression, the displayed sprite image file will swap between different speaker variations, such that you don't have the same static image file across large swathes of dialogue. Visually, while a character is speaking, it's nice to have their sprite change with each line, even if only slightly, so as to indicate the active speaker status.</p>

<p>The pattern for the speaker suffix variations is the following sequence: <code>-s</code> to <code>-s2</code> to <code>-s</code> to <code>-s2</code> to <code>-s3</code> to <code>-s</code> to <code>-s3</code> to <code>-s2</code>. And then it repeats.</p>

<h2>(t)hinker</h2>

<p><code>t</code> is similar to <code>s</code> in its format (e.g., <code>t=jake</code>) and that it puts characters in the speaker box if not on-screen. However, unlike <code>s</code>, that's all <code>t</code> does — it doesn't also update their status/file to be speaking. <code>t</code> is therefore mainly used for the cases where an author says that a character is thinking something, but does so while still using dialogue-type quotes e.g.:</p>

<pre>
"The most human of all human traits is inconsistency," he thought.
t=henry
</pre>

<p>Both <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> while active cause the character's name to appear on-screen as e.g., "Henry" and "Henry (thinking)" respectively. Also, text without quotes is bolded while either tag is active, to make it visually easier to tell the dialogue from non-dialogue.</p>

<h2>(z)oom</h2>

<p><code>z</code> accepts a name and then one or three additional arguments like <code>z:swordguy=97</code> or <code>z:critic=90,49,5</code>. The first number is either case represents the character's zoom level — how large they should appear on-screen, where 100 is the default. Since all character sprites are the same size — 1376x768 pixels — this sizing metadata is necessary for changing the effective height of characters to appropriate relative levels. The latter two numeric arguments represent the horizontal and vertical positioning of the character when in the speaker box.</p>

<h2>(v)iew</h2>

<p><code>v</code> sets the horizontal spacing and vertical sizing of characters while on-screen like <code>v=90,125</code>. Both values again default to 100, where lowering the first value squeezes characters closer together and raising the first value moves them further apart. Lowering the second value decreases the size of sprites and raising it increases their size.</p>

<h2>(f)ilter</h2>

<p><code>f</code> is a tag that can be applied to either a character (e.g., <code>f:c:jake=blur(5px)</code>) or a background (e.g., <code>f:b:flat-ext=brightness(85%)</code>) to set a css filter on that character's sprites or the background image.</p>

<h2>(m)odifier</h2>

<p><code>m</code> is a tag that allows the activation/deactivation of various parsing modifiers. For example, setting <code>m=</code> disables all modifiers (the default) and setting <code>m=joined;m=margin</code> enables the joined and margin modifiers. The available modifiers are:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>margin</code>: Causes the text display to have padding on either side, as a sort of quasi-blockqoute effect.</li>
<li><code>joined</code>: Causes text from the current line to feed into the next line.</li>
<li><code>nospace</code>: Causes text from the current line to not have an automatic space appended onto it when building the next line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(h)eader</h2>

<p><code>h</code> is a tag similar to <code>m</code> in that it changes parsing behavior. However, unlike <code>m</code>, headers are meant to only be set once, at the beginning of the visual novel, and then don't ever change. Currently there's only one header:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>no-speaker-counter</code>: Causes speaker sprites to not swap between <code>-s2</code> and <code>-s3</code> variations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>(r)eset</h2>

<p><code>r</code> is a tag that is used the same way as background, accepting exactly one background image argument (e.g., <code>r=flat-ext</code>), but which also has a host of other effects. Essentially, <code>r</code> is for cleaning the slate of most of the above tags, setting them back to their default, making it easier to keep track of what is and isn't active when starting a new chapter or scene.</p>

<p>The only tags that <code>r</code> doesn't reset are the three permanent ones: <code>n</code>, <code>h</code>, and <code>z</code>; and then also the <code>a</code> tag, since while we don't expect a character's expression to persist between scenes, their current age generally should.</p>

<h1>The Text Lines</h1>

<p>Like the metadata lines, the text lines occupy every third line of the <code>pulp.txt</code> file format (though the 3N+1 lines instead of the 3N+2 lines). Text lines are never blank, but always have some text in them representing what should be on-screen for the current slide of the VN. The Pulpifier expects that the text on these lines adds up to exactly match the text of the original <code>book.txt</code> file, with a few important rules on how the "adding up" works.</p>

<h2 id="line-break-rules">Line Break Rules</h2>

<p>Given an original book text paragraph like:</p>

<pre>Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street. She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled. We watched her cross the street.</pre>

<p>The <code>pulp.txt</code> file can choose to leave the text exactly as-is, or break it up into smaller chunks via sentence breaks e.g.:</p>

<pre>
Frances Clyne was coming toward us from across the street.


She was a very tall girl who walked with a great deal of movement. She waved and smiled.
e:frances=happy

We watched her cross the street.
</pre>

<p>Note how the pulp text lines don't end in spaces, even though in the original text, there are spaces between sentences. The Pulpifier inserts spaces automatically when building up the comparison string to make sure that the overall text is identical.</p>

<p>Also note how the second pulp text line has multiple sentences still together. It's perfectly acceptable for a single line to have multiple sentences, and in that case they stay spaced the same. The only thing that isn't acceptable is inserting line breaks in-between sentences, like putting a break between "Frances Clyne was coming toward" and "us from across the street." — this would cause a parsing error. (However, the Pulpifier does allow splitting of sentences by characters such as em dashes, semicolons, colons, and even commas. Generally, this is undesirable — it's preferable to not split up single sentences in this way — but sometimes it can be unavoidable from a presentation perspective, and so if a split does need to happen, it should at least happen with the grammar.)</p>

<h2 id="quote-handling">Quote Handling</h2>

<p>When it comes to dialogue, things get slightly more complicated. Take for instance this book text:</p>

<pre>
“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice. And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword. Isn’t that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.

“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you, Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well. You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us. So now he’s going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.
</pre>

<p>Split up in the pulp format, it looks like this:</p>

<pre>
“You mustn’t misunderstand, Jake, it was absolutely platonic with the secretary. Not even platonic. Nothing at all, really. It was just that she was so nice.”
e:frances=smirking

“And he did that just to please me. Well, I suppose that we that live by the sword shall perish by the sword.”
e:frances=happy

“Isn’t that literary, though? You want to remember that for your next book, Robert.”


“You know Robert is going to get material for a new book. Aren’t you, Robert? That’s why he’s leaving me. He’s decided I don’t film well.”


“You see, he was so busy all the time that we were living together, writing on this book, that he doesn’t remember anything about us.”


“So now he’s going out and get some new material. Well, I hope he gets something frightfully interesting.”
</pre>

<p>Note how while in the original text, the dialogue had only two opening quotes and no closing quotes, the pulp text has a opening and closing quote on each line. This is a necessary change in order to accomodate the visual novel format in a way that isn't confusing. Since we can't see the full dialogue all at once, we can't really follow the same literary quotation rules as books do. Otherwise we'd end up with lines with no quotes around them, even though they're dialogue.</p>

<p>In a book format, putting quotes around each individual line would change the effective speaker, since at that point the reader would interpret the dialogue as switching back-and-forth. In a visual novel though, this isn't a problem, because the speaker always appears with their name and sprite on-screen while talking — there's never any ambiguity. Therefore, adding additional quotes should never change the effective reading experience.</p>

<p>It is still important to keep quotes around though, since they are necessary for lines with combined dialogue and non-dialogue parts e.g.:</p>

<pre>
“What’s his name?” asked Brett. “Veuve Cliquot?”
s=brett

“No,” said the count. “Mumms. He’s a baron.”
s=count

“Isn’t it wonderful,” said Brett. “We all have titles. Why haven’t you a title, Jake?”
s=brett;e:brett=happy
</pre>

<p>The quotes here are still necessary for the reader to know what is and isn't being spoken. This is helped by bolding the text within the dialogue quotes, using the same font weight as the bold used for the speaker name text, so that it's visually obvious which parts are and aren't associated with the speaker.</p>

<h2>Html Handling</h2>

<p>Generally, most pulp lines don't need any particular custom html handling. The Pulpifier automatically converts *italics* and **uppercase** and ## Headers all to their appropriate html.</p>

<p>However, custom html is supported in the form of adding spans with class names as-needed for special cases. For example, the following pulp text is valid:</p>

<pre>
It had been forwarded from Paris:


&lt;span class='uppercase'&gt;Could you come Hotel Montana Madrid am rather in trouble Brett.&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>

<p>The span html text is stripped from the text comparison with the original, such that it doesn't count as changing the text. Therefore, arbitrary css styling can be applied when needed.</p>

<h2>Editor's Notes</h2>

<p>Lastly, pulp lines can contain "Editor's Notes" formatted like:</p>

<pre>
“I reverse the order. For Bryan’s sake. As a tribute to the Great Commoner. First the chicken; then the egg.”&lt;e&gt;Based William Jennings Bryan reference.&lt;/e&gt;
s=bill
</pre>

<p>The Pulpifier automatically converts the custom e tags into span-html, and also removes the e tag text from the original text comparison. This allows arbitrary Editor's Note text (or even html, including scripts!) to be added, though the notes aren't visible by default.</p>
