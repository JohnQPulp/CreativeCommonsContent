<p>Happy Public Domain Day 2026.</p>

<p>Today seems the appropriate day to declare the Public Domain Pulp site as online. Not as <i>ready</i>, since it needs more development work and more titles, but at least online.</p>

<p>It would make sense to inaugurate the site today by announcing a book from 1930 now that those have all just entered public domain. That's what Standard Ebooks just did, showing off with an impressive <b>20</b> new titles in <a href='https://standardebooks.org/blog/public-domain-day-2026'>their Public Domain Day post</a>. But for me that runs into the problem of needing the epub to build off of, but not having access to the epub until the day of. And I can't turn around a full book conversion in one day — at least not yet.</p>

<p>So a book from 1929 will have to do for now.</p>

<h2>Announcing <i>Cup of Gold: The Visual Novel</i></h2>

<p>For the first visual novel of the site, I went with the first book of an author I like: John Steinbeck. <i>Cup of Gold: A Life of Sir Henry Morgan, Buccaneer, with Obnoxiously Long Full Title</i> wasn't a book I'd read before. In fact, I forgot it even existed until I went searching for titles published in 1929. And I'm a big enough Steinbeck fan that I had visited the Slimbech museum in Salinas:</p>

<p><i>Cup of Gold</i> is amateurish prose-wise, not really reading like a Steinbeck novel, and overall dubious in premise (though <i><s>Dubious in Battle</s></i> <i>In Dubious Battle</i> is probably still the more boring read overall). The Goodreads blurb advertises the book as adding "new dimensions to readers' perceptions of this all-American writer", which I agree with as a backhanded compliment.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, <i><a href='/vn/CupOfGold/pulp.html'>Cup of Gold: The Visual Novel</a></i> now exists, in what I believe is the first ever public domain visual novel (or CC0 visual novel of a public domain text to be precise).</p>

<p>Certainly it's the first one I've made as part of the project, and that does show in some of the VN editing. Much like early Steinbeck, I've still got a lot to learn when it comes to making a good, entertaining final product. But it is readable, and viewable — technically valid at least. And free!</p>

<h2>The Process and The Plan</h2>

<p>Unlike Steinbeck, my role will not be in writing the fiction (which is a career I could never pursue, because I'm not insane), but in developing the process for converting existing fiction into quality visual novels. And figuring out that process is still ongoing. The creation of this first one took several weeks — longer than expected — and required significant manual input.</p>

<p>But over time as the codebase and conversion process stabilizes, it should get much more efficient. The images are obviously already created by AI (with manual curation), but in order to get fast book-to-VN turnarounds, the metadata process will need to be more AI-driven too. Parts of it, I think should be doable. Other aspects of the metadata, in particular those that deal with the visuals, I think might require manual entry for some time yet.</p>

<p>But whatever it takes to get there, the plan is and will be to get all the major famous works of the public domain converted into readable (playable?) VNs. To have a catalogue as big as Standard Ebooks. As big as Gutenberg! <i>As big as HathiTrust!</i> (Maybe not that last one.)</p>

<p>So huzzah for Public Domain Day. Drink up some Captain Morgan rum in celebration of <i>Cup of Gold's</i> Captain Henry Morgan protagonist, wrong year though that book may be for 2026.</p>

<p>But works from 1930 and from many other years will soon be forthcoming. The best-written visual novels in existence will soon all be on only this site (and open source on Github).</p>
