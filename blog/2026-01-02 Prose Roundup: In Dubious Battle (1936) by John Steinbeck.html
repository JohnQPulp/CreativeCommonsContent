<h4>Chapter 1</h4>
<blockquote>A Gillette razor was in the bag, four pairs of new socks and another grey flannel shirt.</blockquote>
<p>Brand name product mention on page one of Steinbeck's pinko commie novel.</p>
<h4>Chapter 2</h4>
<blockquote>"Well, the cops sent a dick to question the kids on the block, and a cop came and talked to my mother. Finally they said they’d keep their eyes open. And that was all. We never heard of her again, ever."</blockquote>
<p>Heh heh heh… he said "dick".</p>
<h4>Chapter 6</h4>
<blockquote>Me an' Jim here get a sock in the puss now and then.</blockquote>
<p>Alright maybe laughing at the archaic usage of "dick" is immature, but you can't not smile at someone being socked in the puss.</p>
<blockquote>London sat on his bed, his tonsured head forward.</blockquote>
<p>There are <b>eight</b> uses of the word "tonsure" in this relatively short book. I don't remember it ever being used in his other writings, but maybe it's one of his tics that you only notice once you start noticing — could be like his hidden obsessions with milk and snake and snake milk.</p>
<h4>Chapter 8</h4>
<blockquote>"Deus vult," said Burton. "Did you see those pointers of Anderson's? Beautiful dogs; they give me a sensual pleasure, almost sexual."</blockquote>
<p>Were I the editor, I'd say drop the semicolon here.</p>
<h4>Chapter 13</h4>
<blockquote>Oh, he’s smart all right. Smart like a snake. Sam’s a rattlesnake, only he don’t never rattle.</blockquote>
<p>Steinbeck couldn't name any other snakes.</p>
<h4>Chapter 14</h4>
<blockquote>An' granpaw fought in the Battle of Bull Run. He always said he thought it was a bull-fight instead of a battle he was goin' to 'til they started shootin' at him.</blockquote>
<p>Not as bad as other granpaw looking for man asses.</p>
<blockquote>If there's a fight, an' our guys get first blood, they’ll put up a hell of a battle.</blockquote>
<p>Weak strategizing that comes from not studying Rambo.</p>
<h4>Chapter 15</h4>
<blockquote>"I like cats," Lisa agreed softly. "I had two cats onct, two of them."</blockquote>
<p>Editor? And for proof of the typo:</p>

<p>Unreadable.</p>
