<h4>1. Boston Mercy</h4>
<blockquote>Technical Sergeant Garp, the late gunner whose familiarity with violent death cannot be exaggerated, served with the Eighth Air Force—the air force that bombed the Continent from England.</blockquote>
<p>Ooh, a funny novel set in the Allied air command. This 600-page book wastes no time in breaking new literary ground.</p>

<blockquote>And she found little gimmicks to help her remember their names and their disasters. Thus: Private Jones fell off his bones, Ensign Potter stopped a whopper, Corporal Estes lost his testes, Captain Flynn has no skin, Major Longfellow is short on answers.</blockquote>
<p>The best part about the rhyming of testes with invented character "Estes" (only mention) is that Irving had five examples here. He could have just cut it down to three!</p>

<h4>2. Blood and Blue</h4>
<blockquote>She finished such books promptly, but she had nothing to say about them. In a school community, someone who reads a book for some secretive purpose, other than discussing it, is strange.</blockquote>
<p>Well that depends a lot on what the books are. Maybe she just finished <book>In Dubious Battle</book>, where the conversational entertainment value is as blood from a stone.</p>

<blockquote>“What do you hear the boys call me?” the dean asked.

“‘Mad Dog’?” asked Garp.</blockquote>

<h4>3. What He Wanted to Be When He Grew Up</h4>
<blockquote>“Writers do not read for fun,” Garp would write, later, speaking for himself.</blockquote>
<p>As this book descends further into that always-masturbatory affair of writers writing characters who are also writers, it's good that Irving takes the time out to make sure we know Garp is only speaking for himself here. (Remember: don't ask Irving if the book is autobiographical.)</p>

<blockquote>No score was cited beneath this portrait, but if anyone in the Steering Athletic Department had possessed a sense of humor, Jenny might have read: <small>UNITED STATES</small> 16, <small>GERMANY</small> 1. Sixteen was the number of planes Miles Seabrook shot down before the Germans scored on him.</blockquote>
<p>Discretion is the better part of humor. Not making a joke that needs to be explained afterwards could just as well indicate a refined sense of humor as a lack of one.</p>

<blockquote>She was the brains of the family, he was fond of saying—and she had her mother’s fine looks, which he never mentioned.</blockquote>
<p>Woah woah slow down there Tolstoy. A chick who's smart <b>and</b> good-looking?</p>

<blockquote>“Oh, Jesus,” Garp groaned. “His <i>daughter</i> wrestles?”

“No, she reads a lot,” Jenny said, approvingly.</blockquote>
<p>Oh, Jesus, my mind almost got blown there. Thank God she doesn't actually wrestle. (Though women shouldn't read either.)</p>

<blockquote>“She’s only fifteen, too. And she wears <i>glasses</i>,” she added, hypocritically. After all, she knew what <i>she</i> thought of glasses; maybe Garp liked them, too. “They’re from <i>Iowa</i>,” she added, and felt she was being a more terrible snob than those hated dandies who thrived in the Steering School community.

“God, <i>wrestling</i>,” Garp groaned, again, and Jenny felt relieved that he had passed on from the subject of Helen. Jenny was embarrassed at herself for how much she clearly objected to the possibility. The girl <i>is</i> pretty, she thought—though not in an obvious way; and don’t young boys like only <i>obvious</i> girls? And would I prefer it if Garp were interested in one of those?

As for <i>those</i> kinds of girls, Jenny had her eye on Cushie Percy—a little too saucy with her mouth, a little too slack about her appearance; and should a fifteen-year-old of Cushman Percy’s breeding be so <i>developed</i> already? Then Jenny hated herself for even thinking of the word <i>breeding</i>.</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis <b>not</b> mine. Look Irving, I like that you gave Iowa a shout-out, but could slow down with the damned italics everywhere?</p>

<h4>4. Graduation</h4>
<blockquote>She wore dark green knee socks and a gray flannel skirt, with pleats; often her sweater, always a dark and solid color, matched her knee socks, and always her long dark hair was up, twirled in a braid on top of her head, or complexly pinned. She had a wide mouth with very thin lips and she never wore lipstick.</blockquote>
<p>This character is just Daria Morgendorffer.</p>

<blockquote>When he was at Steering he read Joseph Conrad’s “The Secret Sharer” thirty-four times. He also read D. H. Lawrence’s “The Man Who Loved Islands” twenty-one times; he felt ready to read it again, now.</blockquote>
<p>My favorite part of re-reading short stories is counting the exact number of times I've re-read them.</p>
<p>And while we're doing exact counts: five mentions of Joseph Conrad in this book, always brought up in a gushing way, no matter who the character is. Including not just Garp and his mother and <span class="s">his wife</span> and <span class="s">Ellen James</span>, but also injured student athletes, who I guess find no greater comfort in the hospital than reading <book>Heart of Darkness</book>?</p>
<p>Look Irving, it's fine to have your authors you like to return to, but you've got to vary the mentions. Like I mentioned Tolstoy already, and I do generally like Tolstoy, but I can absolutely still bitch about <book>Father Sergius</book> or the ending of <book>War and Peace</book>.</p>

<h4>5. In the City Where Marcus Aurelius Died</h4>
<blockquote>In truth, Jenny would not have been mistaken for a prostitute by most people, but it is hard to say exactly what she looked like.</blockquote>
<p>Well you're the author, so… (Remember Irving, DUET: Difficult-for-Us/Easy-for-Them.)</p>

<h4>6. The Pension Grillparzer</h4>
<blockquote>Charlotte was the color of the dull ice on the brackish Steering River.</blockquote>
<p>Look Irving, I too have seen the Iowa River in Iowa City. But this description is still not as useful as you think, from my reader's perspective.</p>

<blockquote>She did not tell him that she was referring to Jenny’s book, <i>A Sexual Suspect</i>; it was 1,158 manuscript pages long. Though Helen would later agree with Garp that it was no literary jewel, she had to admit that it was a very compelling story.</blockquote>
<p>I call foul on the book being ~300k words long in the context of how the rest of the plot develops. To the extent that books ever become cultural sensations, it's not from books of that length. It's simply impossible. It's— wait, how long is this book?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Huh, I'll be damned. (Man, there really was nothing better to do in the 70s than <i>read</i>. What a terrible decade.)</p>

<h4>7. More Lust</h4>
<blockquote>“The new fiction is interested in language and in f-f-form, I guess,” Tinch said. “But I don’t understand what it’s really about. Sometimes it’s about it-it-itself, I think,” Tinch said.

“About itself?” Garp said.

“It’s sort of fiction about fi-fi-<i>fic</i>tion,” Tinch told him.</blockquote>
<p>You know what other long-ass book got published in the 70s? <book>Gödel, Escher, Bach</book>. And you are no Hofstadter to me, Irving, so knock it off.</p>

<blockquote>She was taken as the right voice at the right time, but Jenny Fields, sitting whitely in her nurse’s uniform—in the restaurant where John Wolf took only his favorite writers—felt discomfort at the word <i>feminism</i>.</blockquote>
<p>Three appearances or "whitely" as an adverb in this book. Now I'm no Stephen King grouch, but at the same time: really?</p>

<blockquote>She would rise and say, “This is right.” Or, sometimes, “This is wrong”—depending on the occasion. She was the decision maker who’d made the hard choices in her own life and therefore she could be counted on to be on the right side of a woman’s problem.</blockquote>
<p>I love it when books have a character that all the other characters always agree with because they could never be wrong. It's a trope that only appears <i>every other God-damned book</i>. (I guess some credit to Irving for not making that character the protagonist, or his love interest, or the protagonist <b>and</b> his love interest. It's slightly different!)</p>

<blockquote>“Well, there’s a whole <i>society</i> of women now,” Jenny informed him, “because of what happened to Ellen James.”

“What happened to her?” Garp asked.

“Two men raped her when she was eleven years old,” Jenny said. “Then they cut her tongue off so she couldn’t tell anyone who they were or what they looked like. They were so stupid that they didn’t know an eleven-year-old could <i>write.</i> Ellen James wrote a very careful description of the men, and they were caught, and they were tried and convicted. In jail, someone murdered them.”

“Wow,” Garp said. “So <i>that’s</i> Ellen James?” he whispered, indicating the big quiet woman with new respect.

Jenny rolled her eyes again. “No,” she said. “That is someone from the Ellen James <i>Society.</i> Ellen James is still a child; she’s a wispy-looking little blond girl.”

“You mean this Ellen James Society goes around not talking,” Garp said, “as if <i>they</i> didn’t have any tongues?”

“No, I mean they <i>don’t</i> have any tongues,” Jenny said. “People in the Ellen James Society have their tongues cut <i>off.</i> To protest what happened to Ellen James.”</blockquote>
<p>Alright so that's terrible. And absurd, and obnoxious; and not remotely in a comedic way. But at least it's over.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What do you mean it also becomes a major plot point throughout the rest of the 400+ pages still left in this book? Irving no! Don't—</p>

<blockquote>“I feel uneasy,” Garp wrote, “that my life has come in contact with so much rape.” Apparently, he was referring to the ten-year-old in the city park, to the eleven-year-old Ellen James and her terrible society—his mother’s wounded women with their symbolic, self-inflicted speechlessness. And later he would write a novel, which would make Garp more of “a household product,” which would have much to do with rape. Perhaps rape’s offensiveness to Garp was that it was an act that disgusted him with himself—with his own very male instincts, which were otherwise so unassailable. He never felt like raping anyone; but rape, Garp thought, made men feel guilty by association.

In Garp’s own case, he likened his guilt for the seduction of Little Squab Bones to a rapelike situation. But it was hardly a rape.</blockquote>
<p>There's so much going on here!</p>
<ul>
<li>The stupid use of "apparently" in the second sentence.</li>
<li>Seven uses of "rape" in as many sentences.</li>
<li>The novelty adjective "rapelike".</li>
<li>The comical protesting-too-much nature of "He never felt like raping anyone".</li>
</ul>
<p>This is all meant to be a juxtaposition of the comically absurd with the serious I suppose? And some of this could be funny in isolation, as Norm Macdonald bits. <i>But maybe not with ten- and eleven-year-olds as the subject matter.</i></p>
<p>I can't even quote the story about the ten-year-old here since it's too long and detailed — it spans multiple pages. (Which still isn't the most drawn-out rape story in the book.)</p>
<p>All this is to say: you can really tell when a book was written in the 70s, and I can't think of any book that suffers more from it than this one.</p>

<h4>8. Second Children, Second Novels, Second Love</h4>
<blockquote>“A thtudent!” Alice wailed. “A thtupid little twat!”</blockquote>
<p>But if the previous comedy routines didn't do it for you, here's some Biggus Dickus dialogue.</p>

<blockquote>It was a book full of wounding dialogue and sex that left the partners smarting; sex in the book also left the partners guilty, and usually wanting more sex. This paradox was cited by several reviewers who called the phenomenon, alternately, “brilliant” and “dumb.”</blockquote>
<p>The continued annoying meta-commentary aside, what exactly does Irving think a "paradox" is?</p>

<blockquote><i>Dear Shithead,</i>

[wrote the offended party]

<i>I have read your novel. You seem to find other people’s problems very funny. I have seen your picture. With your fat head of hair I suppose you can laugh at bald persons. And in your cruel book you laugh at people who can’t have orgasms, and people who aren’t blessed with happy marriages, and people whose wives and husbands are unfaithful to each other. You ought to know that persons who have these problems do not think everything is so funny. Look at the world, shithead—it is a bed of pain, people suffering and nobody believing in God or bringing their children up right. You shithead, you don’t have any problems so you can make fun of poor people who do!</i></blockquote>
<p>But say what you will about Irving, he was ahead of his time in more ways than one: he could have been a great internet political cartoonist! (Everyone knows you can preclude all criticisms of your writing by getting ahead of the haters and showing how stupid they sound in your own words.)</p>

<h4>9. The Eternal Husband</h4>
<blockquote>About the only shoes he owned were running shoes—many pairs.</blockquote>
<p>He owns mostly running shoes but also some other shoes. So like every other man.</p>

<h4>10. The Dog in the Alley, the Child in the Sky</h4>

<blockquote>The responsibilities loomed for Garp, every time. What is the instinct in people that makes them expect something to <i>happen</i>? If you begin a story about a person or a dog, something must be going to happen to them. “Go on!” Walt cried impatiently.</blockquote>
<p>Go f&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; off here, Irving. I don't need more of your annoying meta-commentary to remind me, the stupid idiot reader, that stories can be enjoyed for more than just their plot events.</p>
<p>I like good prose. I can <b>appreciate</b> good prose on its own merits. And this book has plenty of good prose ­— it's not poorly written by any means. But you wedge in some of the most obnoxious defensive-writing tics I've ever had the misfortune of slogging through.</p>

<h4>12. It Happens to Helen</h4>

<blockquote>It was in this mood, beset with trivia, that Helen encountered the smug young man slouched in the hall by her office door with the top two buttons of his nice shirt unbuttoned. The shoulders of his tweed jacket were, she noticed, slightly padded; his hair was a bit too lank, and too long, and one end of his mustache—as thin as a knife—drooped too far down at the corner of his mouth. She was not sure if she wanted to love this young man or <i>groom</i> him.</blockquote>
<p>Heh heh heh… words change meaning over time — doesn't make it not funny.</p>

<blockquote>Helen, he knew, was <i>reading</i> someone else. It did not occur to Garp that she might be contemplating more than literature, but he saw with a typical writer’s jealousy that someone else’s <i>words</i> were keeping her up at night.</blockquote>
<p>Credit where credit's due: Irving gets ahead of the fiction-reading-as-cuckoldry meme by several decades! This is the kind of writer-focused commentary I can actually appreciate, because it's 1. A funny bit 2. A short bit and 3. Self-deprecating instead of insulting to the reader.</p>

<blockquote>But now he saw <i>his</i> chance for a little cruelty—and/or a little truth—and his eyes shone at her brightly.</blockquote>
<p>Three uses of "and/or" in this book. I appreciate Irving fight the good fight for trying to make the desperately needed word respectable in professional prose, but it has still not come to pass.</p>

<h4>14. The World According to Marcus Aurelius</h4>

<blockquote>Garp was convinced that the mainstream of his fans consisted of waifs, lonely children, retarded grownups, cranks, and only occasional members of the citizenry who were not afflicted with perverted taste.</blockquote>
<p>I'll own "crank", to be sure. But I have to quibble with the "pervert" part. It's true all writers are perverts, but I don't most of the general citizenry are. (Readers are probably about half-half.)</p>

<blockquote>It was in the late summer of Garp’s convalescence that <i>The World According to Bensenhaver</i> was begun.</blockquote>
<p>A great sense of fatigue came over me reading this sentence. Did Irving think he was being clever was this? <i>Was this considered clever in the 70s?</i> I refuse to believe it.</p>

<blockquote>The man wore cowboy boots and green suede bell-bottom pants. He was tall and chesty, though not quite as tall and chesty as Roberta Muldoon.

“I’m not a dyke,” Roberta said.

“Well, you’re no vestal virgin either,” the man said. “Where the fuck is Laurel?” He wore an orange T-shirt with bright green letters between his nipples.<p class='center'>SHAPE UP!</p>the letters read.</blockquote>
<img alt="SHAPE UP!" src="/images/shape-up.webp" />

<h4>15. The World According to Bensenhaver</h4>

<blockquote><small>Below him a lurid turquoise pickup moved ahead with the traffic; its fenders were pockmarked, its grille bashed in and black with mashed flies and—Standish imagined—the heads of imbedded birds.</small></blockquote>
<p>The repetition of the same beats in the inner stories as in the outer story is just… well obviously it's intentional, but that doesn't make me any happier about how long these inner stories are. This one is 40 pages long — an entire chapter!</p>

<blockquote><small>Inspector Arden Bensenhaver, who knew a good deal about rape, announced that he had to get on with his job.</small></blockquote>
<p>Knowing a good deal about rape may sound impressive, but recall that Steinbeck's Henry Morgan protagonist was an "authority on rape". So your move, Irving. (See what I mean about all authors being perverts?)</p>

<blockquote><small>Arden Bensenhaver, of course, couldn’t know that the man in the black pickup hadn’t really been alone—that, in fact, Hope Standish had been lying with her head in his lap.</small></blockquote>
<p>Usually when an author uses "of course" in a sentence, they're being smug about something that isn't actually obvious. But in this case the "of course" is warranted — the sentence is completely redundant in the context it appears. Which is… worse?</p>

<h4>16. The First Assassin</h4>

<blockquote>And John Wolf knew this: one of the first things most readers <i>want</i> to know is everything they can about a writer’s <i>life.</i> John Wolf wrote Garp: “For most people, with limited imaginations, the idea of improving on reality is pure bunk.”</blockquote>
<p>To the first sentence I say: there's probably a bit of self-selection bias going on in your lived experiences, Irving. And to the second sentence I say: f&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; off.</p>

<blockquote>“Wait and write it after I’m dead,” Helen said.

Everyone laughed.

“But there are only three,” John Wolf said. “What then? What happens after the three?”

“I die,” Garp said. “That will make six novels altogether, and that’s enough.”

Everyone laughed again.</blockquote>
<p>Has an "everyone laughed" ever been deserved in a novel? And we get two here!</p>

<blockquote>Wolf was being careful; he had already let it slip that he thought <i>The World According to Bensenhaver</i> was an “X-rated soap opera.” Garp hadn’t seemed bothered. “Mind you, it’s awfully well <i>written</i>,” Wolf had said, “but it’s still, somehow, soap opera; it’s too <i>much</i>, somehow.” Garp had sighed. “<i>Life</i>,” Garp had said, “is too much, somehow. <i>Life</i> is an X-rated soap opera, John,” Garp had said.</blockquote>
<p>The absolute audacity of this man to call his own self-insert author's writing "awfully well written". Course I'd still be lying if I said Irving <i>wasn't</i> a good writer — he is! — but damnit if he doesn't shoot himself in the foot by being an annoying idiot in these parts.</p>

<blockquote>The incumbent governor was in favor of all the same, swinish, stupid things. The woman running against him seemed educated and idealistic and kind; she also seemed to barely restrain her anger at the same, swinish, stupid things the governor represented.</blockquote>
<p>If you thing Irving is being tongue-in-cheek with how thick he's laying on who's right and wrong here, just you read his 2018 foreward to the book's 40th anniversary edition!</p>


<h4>17. The First Feminist Funeral, and Other Funerals</h4>

<blockquote>“Ever since <span class="spoiler">Walt died</span>,” wrote T. S. Garp, “my life has felt like an epilogue.”</blockquote>
<p>Well at least Irving's aware about when the book peaked. What a prick though for keeping it going for another 200 pages and rubbing that in the reader's face.</p>
<p>In a more interesting development, I think it was about at this point in reading that an old card fell out of the book — always a cool find — in this case some sort of student ID:</p>
<img alt="Student ID" src="/images/garp-id-card.webp" />
<p>The book not being read since 1981 seems about right to me for how deeply 70s it is.</p>

<blockquote>“You didn’t miss nothin’, sweetie,” the cabby told him. “That broad broke down.”

“Sally Devlin?” said Garp.

“She cracked up, right on the TV,” the cabby said. “She was so flipped out over the assassination, she couldn’t control herself. She was givin’ this speech but she couldn’t get through it, you know?

“She looked like a real idiot to me,” the cabby said. “She couldn’t be no governor if she couldn’t control herself no better than that.”

And Garp saw the pattern of the woman’s loss emerging. Perhaps the foul incumbent governor had remarked that Ms. Devlin’s inability to control her emotions was “just like a woman.” Disgraced by her demonstration of her feelings for Jenny Fields, Sally Devlin was judged not competent enough for whatever dubious work being a governor entailed.</blockquote>
<p>That misogynistic standard of… not wanting prospective governors to fall apart under mild pressure. Ah, who's the real sexist now, huh Irving?</p>

<blockquote>“Perhaps, when we’re in the air,” the man said, knowingly, “I could buy you a little drink?” His small, close-together eyes were riveted on the twisted zipper of Garp’s straining turquoise jump suit.</blockquote>
<p>I previously said Irving was an obvious product of the 70s, but this commentary is ripped straight from <i>Some Like it Hot</i>!</p>

<blockquote>    <i>The best rape story I have ever read,</i>

wrote Ellen James.</blockquote>
<p>Again, the stupidity of the line is pretty funny out-of-context but really awful in-context.</p>

<blockquote>“And what do you want to be?” he asked her, barely keeping himself from adding: <i>When you grow up.</i>

She pointed to him and blushed. She actually touched his gross breasts.

“A writer?” Garp guessed. She relaxed and smiled; he understood her so easily, her face seemed to say.</blockquote>
<p>Make it stop… no… no more writer characters.</p>

<blockquote>Garp noticed that the gnarled thumb and index finger of her writing hand were easily twice the size of the unused instruments on her other hand; she had a writing muscle such as he’d never seen.</blockquote>
<p>That's more horrific than all the other body horror in this book, and I don't think this one was intentional!</p>


<h4>18. Habits of the Under Toad</h4>

<blockquote>There were the expectable personal letters to Ellen James: condolences from idiots, propositions from sick men—the ugly, antifeminist tyrants and baiters of women who, as Garp had warned Ellen, would see themselves as being on <i>her</i> side.</blockquote>
<p>Part of me wants to call this line out for its ridiculous heavy-handedness, but the cattiness of also calling the evil men "ugly" somehow makes it loop around to being funny.</p>

<h4>19. Life After Garp</h4>

<blockquote>“Life,” Garp wrote, “is sadly <i>not</i> structured like a good old-fashioned novel. Instead, an ending occurs when those who are meant to peter out have petered out. All that’s left is memory. But even a nihilist has a memory.”</blockquote>
<p>Irving, you would have liked Houellebecq if only he had been writing back then. (Though come to think of it, both of you are unfortunately still alive.)</p>

<blockquote>The flag was at half-mast for the former tight end Robert Muldoon. The scoreboard flashed 90! 90! 90! Duncan noted how the times had changed; for example, there were feminist funerals everywhere now; he had just read about a big one in Nebraska. And in Philadelphia the sports announcer managed to say, without snickering, that the flag flew at half-mast for <i>Roberta</i> Muldoon.

“<i>She</i> was a fine athlete,” the announcer mumbled. “A great pair of hands.”

“An extraordinary person,” agreed the co-announcer.</blockquote>
<p>And the football crowd's booings went wild.</p>

<blockquote>“There’s no sex like transsex!”</blockquote>

<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>This was a largely negative roundup, but I wouldn't say <i>Garp</i> is a bad book per-se. The prose is good and even funny in parts, but probably not as many parts nowadays as the author intended. It suffers more than other books as a product of its time in a few big ways:</p>
<p>First, there's all the writings-within-writings and writer characters and meta writing commentary. I guess this seemed more interesting back in the day, before Hofstadter blew all such works out of the water (the very next year!) with GEB. But as <i>Garp</i> stands now, I got annoyed basically every time the book reminded me how many of its characters were writers.</p>
<p>Second, the book is just too deeply tied to the specific politics of the 70s — 2nd-wave feminism and <i>Taxi Driver</i> turbulence — to be particularly insightful or compelling to the modern reader. In Irving's 40-year edition introduction to the book, he says:</p>
<blockquote><i>Garp</i> is a political novel, and the politics of sexual intolerance and suppression haven’t gone away.</blockquote>
<p>Which is true, but he also writes:</p>
<blockquote>In 1976–77, when I was living in Massachusetts and Vermont, where I finished <i>Garp</i>, it was inconceivable to me that the sexual violence I was writing about would long endure. In short, I thought sexual discrimination was too backward and too stupid to last.</blockquote>
<p>Which makes him come across as an idiot, if he really thinks nothing has changed between 1978 and now. Or maybe he does think things have changed, but he was expecting perfect sexual harmony by now? Which is… also not very compelling as a political perspective. (Or the other other interpretation, which is that perhaps the 40-year intro he wrote was a quick cash-grab, which I could respect more.)</p>
<p>But in any case: Third and last, the book suffers form being gross in the way that everything from the 70s is gross. Which is a lesser complaint, and shouldn't be considered a deal-breaker for valueing works of that decade. But I think I'll still prefer to get my rapey political commentary from <i>Zardoz</i>, if I have to choose one.</p>
