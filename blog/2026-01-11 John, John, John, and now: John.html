<p>Yesterday I finished the editing on <i><a href='/vn/TheThirtyNineSteps'>The Thirty-Nine Steps: The Visual Novel</a></i>, the second visual novel of the site, now online and ready for reading.</p>

<img alt="The Thirty-Nine Steps VN preview" src="/vn/TheThirtyNineSteps/images/preview.webp" />

<p>But the astute reader will have noticed that this book's author is a certain <b>John</b> Buchan, whose first name has thus far dominated the site: we've had <i><a href='/vn/CupOfGold'>Cup of Gold: The Visual Novel</a></i> by <b>John</b> Steinbeck. Then the first prose roundup for <book>In Dubious Battle</book>, also by him. Then the next prose roundup for a <b>John</b> Irving novel. And this all being on the website of <b>John</b> Q. Pulp.</p>

<p>So why so many Johns?</p>


<h2>John Q. Pulp</h2>

<p>In the olden days of two months ago, as I was piecing together the idea for what would be my Public Domain Pulp site, I had to tackle the problem of needing a name. It needed to be a pseudonym, and for that I kept coming back to John Q. Public. It was perfect! With it, the site would be John Q. Public's Public Domain Pulp.</p>

<p>But of course the problem with John Q. Public is that it isn't a name you can really claim. Even if someone wasn't <a href="https://github.com/JohnQPublic">squatting the John Q. Public Github username</a>, it still just wouldn't a unique choice.</p>

<p>But that just meant a slight tweak would be needed, and I could do it in a way that still tied into the website name. Thus, John Q. <s>Domain</s> Pulp.</p>


<h2>John Steinbeck</h2>

<p>As part of the early planning, I also had to make a choice of first visual novel. As mentioned in <a href="/blog/2026-01-01">the Public Domain Day 2026 blog post</a>, John Steinbeck seemed the most obvious choice to me. His <i>Cup of Gold</i> had just enetered public domain that very year (2025), and it was his first novel (thematically appropriate), and he was an author whose works I both liked and was pretty-well familiar with. So I could speak some authority on them.</p>

<p>For similar reasons I chose him for the first prose roundup as well, though I must say: after the one-two punch of <i>Cup of Gold</i> and <i>In Dubious Battle</i>, I may have to revisit some of the Steinbeck's later works — the ones I remember being <i>good</i> — and see if that opinion still holds up. Some time in the future.</p>


<h2>John Irving</h2>

<p>Least but not last, there was Irving.</p>

<p>Over the Christmas break, I read a few new books: the aforementioned <i>In Dubious Battle</i> since I wanted more context on Steinbeck, <book>The Prince and the Pauper</book> since I also wanted more context on Twain (I had stopped by his museum in Hannibal, Missouri the previous week, and in a future post I'll go into more detail about why Twain is a special author for the website), and then <i>The World According to Garp</i>. Not because I wanted more context on John Irving — I didn't even really know who he was prior to reading — but just because the book had been on my to-read list for a while, and I happened to spot it in a used-book store.</p>

<p>The fact that the name was John as well was a coincidence, and one I didn't even realize at first. I wasn't planning on doing anything for the site for the book — it was meant to be a for-fun read — but then the book did everything in its power to annoy me, and I had to vent about it somewhere. Hence, the prose roundup, which only in the process of writing did I realize again contained "John".</p>

<p>And from there I got an idea:</p>


<h2>John Buchan</h2>

<p>With a coincidental pattern of Johns established, I figured it only made sense to play into the bit and choose another John author for the next visual novel. After all, it's not like it would be slim pickings with there being a million famous John authors out there.</p>

<p>But as it turned out, the vast majority of the Johns fell into two camps. You either had the Johns too recent to be public domain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Updike</li>
<li>Grisham</li>
<li>Kennedy Toole (<book>A Confederacy of Dunces</book> can't enter PD soon enough!)</li>
<li>Cheever</li>
<li>Ronald Reuel Tolkien (so <i>that's</i> what the JRR stands for…)</li>
<li>Green</li>
<li>…etc</li>
</ul>

<p>…Or you had unreadable poet-philosopher Johns:</p>

<ul>
<li>Milton</li>
<li>Stuart Mill</li>
<li>Keats</li>
<li>Locke</li>
<li>Jay</li>
<li>Dewey</li>
<li>…etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone from the first list had to be ruled out by default — no public domain, no hosting. And as for second, well, what the site needed (and still does need) is <b>novels</b> — standard fiction novels — and ideally short ones at that. Both because having more "standard" titles is necessary for growing the catalog with stuff people might actually want to read, and because it's good practice for getting better at the VN conversion process. (Which could indirectly help with potentially getting more experimental later on!)</p>

<p>So I was left with a not particularly impressive list of the remaining public-but-not-"intellectual" Johns, from which I recognized exactly zero of the names. Rather than just drop the idea, I decided to stick with it by throwing a metaphorical dart, thereby selecting John Buchan. His most popular work at least seemed to be a <b>book</b>, and at least looked short.</p>

<p>So I went into <i>The Thirty-Nine Steps</i> thinking Buchan was just some guy, who had just written some pulp novel. And both of those things were half-true, but the man himself and the whole context around his book turned out to be far more interesting than I would have expected:</p>


<h2>The Thirty-Nine Rabbit Holes</h2>

<p>For how light a book <i>39 Steps</i> was on both pages and details, it sure did require an annoying amount of research.</p>

<p>Not that digging into and learning more about Greek politics and the Macedonian front of World War I wasn't interesting, but I had kind of hoped for a quick turnaround for the site's second visual novel. But no dice with Buchan:</p>

<img alt="Buchan" src="/images/buchan.webp" />

<p>So that made creating the editor's note <b>substantially</b> more difficult, to make sure I wasn't missing anything, and that I was getting all my facts straight. But on the plus side, I can recommend the book for that reason alone, so you get to experience the implications of Buchan's writing for yourself.</p>

<p>And then there was just Buchan the man himself. Again, I went into the book thinking we just some obscure writer, and only that, but no: his writing is probably the least interesting aspect of his Wikipedia page. (You know it's a good article when over 700 words are dedicated to the Jews. Which on one hand seems a little much — they weren't <i>that</i> maligned in the book, especially in comparison to other books of the era. But on the other, Buchan was apparently entered into the Golden Book of Israel, which… wait what?)</p>

<p>Buchan had about ten million different titles — always a delightful quirk of those wacky Brits. But the fact that they all weren't just inscrutable generic titles but also <b>Governor General of Canada</b> was rather surprising. Especially considering it wasn't just a brief position, but one he held for years, apparently highly successfully, and into the start of World War II.</p>

<p>These findings weren't something I could make as much editor's note content out of for the VN, but were nonetheless interesting. And I think it was an encouraging experience for how much historical entertainment value was to be had from the mining of an essentially randomly chosen author. It bodes well for the many hundreds of other "random" authors of the public domain.</p>


<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I think I'll keep up the John bit for one more prose roundup. Those don't need to be public domain books, and the selection there is fine. But after that, at least for the visual novels, it's time to return to an author with actual name-recognition.</p>

<p>And in particular, I want an author writing in a setting that <i>isn't</i> Britain. Since after the one-two punch of having to create all the Welsh countryside backgrounds for <i>Cup of Gold</i> and then all the Scottish ones for <i>39 Steps</i>, I'm ready for for something more… American.</p>

<p>And I've got just the man in mind. Stay posted for it.</p>


<h2>Bonus</h2>

<p>I couldn't think of anywhere else to include this — there wasn't a good place either in this blog or in the VN's editor's notes — but with <i>39 Steps</i> leaning so heavily into the funny Scottish accents, it'd feel wrong to not at least link to the drinking song from <i>Whiskey Galore!</i>:</p>
