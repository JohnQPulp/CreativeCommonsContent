<p>Yesterday I put the finishing touches on <i><a href='/vn/TheThirtyNineSteps'>The Thirty-Nine Steps: The Visual Novel</a></i>, the second visual novel of the site. It's now online and ready for reading:</p>

<img alt="The Thirty-Nine Steps VN preview" src="/vn/TheThirtyNineSteps/images/preview.webp" />

<p>But the astute reader may have noticed that this one's book is written by a certain <b>John</b> Buchan, whose first name has thus far dominated the site: we've had <i><a href='/vn/CupOfGold'>Cup of Gold: The Visual Novel</a></i> by <b>John</b> Steinbeck. Then the first prose roundup for <book>In Dubious Battle</book>, also by him. Then the next prose roundup for a <b>John</b> Irving novel. And this all being on the website of <b>John</b> Q. Pulp.</p>

<p>So why so many Johns?</p>

<h2>John Q. Pulp</h2>

<h2>John Steinbeck</h2>

<h2>John Irving</h2>

Least but not last, we have Irving.

<h2>John Buchan</h2>

<p>John options:</p>

<ul>
<li></li>
</ul>

<h2>The Thirty-Nine Rabbit Holes</h2>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I think I'll keep this bit going for one more prose roundup. But after that the field of public domain Johns just looks too thin for a next visual novel, and so I'll return to someone with a bit more name recognition.</p>

<p>Stay posted for it.</p>
