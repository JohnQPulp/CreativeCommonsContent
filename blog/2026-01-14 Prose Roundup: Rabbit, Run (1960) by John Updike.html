<blockquote>Boys are playing basketball around a telephone pole with a backboard bolted to it. Legs, shouts. The scrape and snap of Keds on loose alley pebbles seems to catapult their voices high into the moist March air blue above the wires. Rabbit Angstrom, coming up the alley in a business suit, stops and watches, though he’s twenty-six and six three.</blockquote>
<p>Ew, present tense.</p>
<p>Well at least now I know I can dismiss the rest of the book as the writings of a hack.</p>

<blockquote>As they stare hushed he sights squinting through blue clouds of weed smoke, a suddenly dark silhouette like a smokestack in the afternoon spring sky, setting his feet with care, wiggling the ball with nervousness in front of his chest, one widespread pale hand on top of the ball and the other underneath, jiggling it patiently to get some adjustment in air itself.</blockquote>
<p>And if you were worried the whole book will be filled with sentences phrased this disjointedly — don't worry, the dream sequence parts will be even worse.</p>

<blockquote>Yet in his time Rabbit was famous through the county; in basketball in his junior year he set a B-league scoring record that in his senior year he broke with a record that was not broken until four years later, that is, four years ago.</blockquote>
<p>And at this point in the book — page 3 — I was pretty well convinced I had a copy with some sort of punctuation misprinting.</p>

<blockquote>His upper lip nibbles back from his teeth in self-pleasure.</blockquote>
<p>This is the first of many, <i>many</i> points throughout the book where I have no idea what Updike is trying to convey.</p>

<blockquote>Then the commercial shows the seven segments of a Tootsie Roll coming out of the wrapper and turning into the seven letters of “Tootsie.” They, too, sing and dance. Still singing, they climb back into the wrapper. It echoes like an echo chamber. Son of a bitch: cute.</blockquote>
<p>America #1!</p>

<blockquote>Vitaconomy, the modern housewife’s password, the one-word expression for economizing vitamins by the MagiPeel Method.</blockquote>
<p>I was going to make a stupid anachronistic joke about Updike stealing from David Foster Wallace. But what's crazy is that Updike actually outlived DFW!</p>

<blockquote>There seems no escaping it: she is dumb.</blockquote>
<p>Updike performed some sort of magic trick in this book, where all the purple prose somehow elevates the occasional blunt, normal prose into genius comedy. I don't know how he did it.</p>

<blockquote>Though the town and the city meet along the highway that skirts the mountain on the south on the way to Philadelphia fifty miles away, they will never merge, for between them the mountain lifts a broad green spine, two miles long north to south, assaulted by gravel pits and cemeteries and new developments but above a line preserved, hundreds of acres of forest Mt. Judge boys can never wholly explore.</blockquote>
<p>Fifty years from now, when I work on making the first Updike visual novels, these are the kind of sentences that are going to completely break the format.</p>

<blockquote>Dumb.</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand: this sentence. Good.</p>

<blockquote>He is being drawn into Philadelphia. He hates Philadelphia. Dirtiest city in the world they live on poisoned water.</blockquote>
<p>If as an author you feel the need to bastardize punctuation and flow, at least take it out on a city that deserves it. I agree with Updike here.</p>

<blockquote>It seems simple enough, drive all night through the dawn through the morning through the noon park on a beach take off your shoes and fall asleep by the Gulf of Mexico.</blockquote>
<p>It's Rabbit's road trip, but I will point out that there are nicer, closer beaches coming from Philly on the Atlantic side than going all the way to the Gulf.</p>

<blockquote>But he is going east, the worst direction, into unhealth, soot, and stink, a smothering hole where you can’t move without killing somebody.</blockquote>
<p><b>Based.</b></p>

<blockquote>A barefoot Du Pont. Brown legs probably, bitty birdy breasts. Beside a swimming pool in France. Something like money in a naked woman, deep, millions. You think of millions as being white. Sink all the way in softly still lots left. Rich girls frigid? Nymphomaniacs? Must vary.</blockquote>
<p>I wouldn't say Updike's writing style is a slog, since that would imply that it's bad, which it isn't. I would however call it self-indulgent. He makes it as hard to parse as possible, which makes the book take forever to get through, when I have other books I need to read.</p>

<blockquote>He remembers reading in the <i>Saturday Evening Post</i> how 1 goes from Florida to Maine through the most beautiful scenery in the world.</blockquote>
<p>This is the kind of line that exemplifies how the book is both good and also annoying. Because the only sane interpretation of this line is that it's ironic — the marketed American dream vs the reality of what that route's actually like — and yet Rabbit doesn't opine on it at all, so as the reader, you're left to puzzle that out for youself.</p>

<blockquote>The hamburgers had been fatter and warmer than the ones you get in Brewer, and the buns had seemed steamed.</blockquote>
<p>Again: intentionally ironic or no? Is Updike taking the piss out of Rabbit's ignorance that he thinks travelling 5 minutes outside his Pennsylvania town would have any change to culture.</p>

<blockquote>The Mason-Dixon Line.</blockquote>
<p>Ah! <book>Mason & Dixon|Pynchon</book>!</p>

<blockquote>Hunger.</blockquote>
<p>Ah! <book>Hunger|Knut</book>! (Oh wait, he's actually a good author.)</p>

<blockquote>Tothero is overjoyed; it is happiness making him talk so much. “Well then, well then; get dressed. We can’t go to Brewer undressed. Do you need a fresh shirt?”

“Yours wouldn’t fit me, would it?”

“No, Harry, no? What’s your size?”

“Fifteen three.”

“Mine! Mine exactly.”</blockquote>
<p>Is that what people who talk too much do — repeat everything twice? Twice?</p>

<blockquote>So perfect, so consistent is the freedom into which the clutter of the world has been vaporized by the simple trigger of his decision, that all ways seem equally good, all movements will put the same caressing pressure on his skin, and not an atom of his happiness would be altered if Tothero told him they were not going to meet two girls but two goats, and they were going not to Brewer but to Tibet.</blockquote>
<p>All I want to do is quote the funny parts of the book, like hooking up with goats here. But then you have to drag these giant sentences in.</p>

<blockquote>Their alert colorless eyes, little dark smears like their mouths, feed on the strange sight of him and send acid impressions down to be digested in their disgusting big beer-tough stomachs.</blockquote>
<p>Mouths feeling kind of left out here. Every other noun gets a funny adjective.</p>

<blockquote>Distaste, like an involuntary glandular secretion, has stained his throat.</blockquote>
<p>Simile presented without comment.</p>

<blockquote>Tothero is moving back and forth like a crab sideways and bumps into a middle-aged couple strolling along.</blockquote>
<p>This is what I mean about the similes: how much like a crab, Updike? Do you really mean really like a crab? Really? Because that's funny, but I feel you sometimes forget the point of prose is to convey meaning to the reader.</p>

<blockquote>And on a tide of alcohol and stirred semen he steps forward, in a kind of swoon.</blockquote>
<p></p>

<blockquote>The edges of the doorway they pass through seem very vivid and sharp. They will always be here.</blockquote>
<p>Who is "they" in the second sentence?</p>

<blockquote>He sees blue when with one deliberate hand she pries open his jaw and bows his head to her burdened chest.</blockquote>
<p>…Pries?</p>

<blockquote>Galled, he shoves up through her and in addition sets his hand under her jaw and shoves her face so his fingers slip into her mouth and her slippery throat strains.</blockquote>
<p>If this quote immediately followed the last, they might both make more sense. As it stands, I don't understand either.</p>

<blockquote>His sea of seed buckles, and sobs into a still channel.</blockquote>
<p></p>

<blockquote>Wonderful, women, from such hungry wombs to such amiable fat; he wants the heat his groin gave given back in gentle ebb. Best bedfriend, done woman. Bit of bowl about their bellies always. Oh, how! when she got up on him like the bell of a big blue lily slipped down on his slow head. He could have hurt her shoving her jaw.</blockquote>
<p>I guess Updike is one step ahead about the "shoving" critics. This… "poetry" is still questionable to me.</p>

<blockquote>A girl at the table reaches with a very long arm weighted with a bracelet and turns a handle of the wood icebox and cold air sweeps over Rabbit. She has opened the door of the square cave where the cake of ice sits; and there it is, inches from Harry’s eyes, lopsided from melting but still big, holding within its metal-black bulk the white partition that the cakes have when they come bumping down the chute at the ice plant. He leans closer into the cold breath of the ice, a tin-smelling coldness he associates with the metal that makes up the walls of the cave and the ribs of its floor, delicate rhinoceros gray, mottled with the same disease the linoleum has.</blockquote>
<p>I'd describe these dream sequences as borderline unreadable. They're impossible to read without one's eyes glazing over. And they go on.</p>
<p>I think this applies to all books, really. Whatever charm authors think describing dreams have in books, they're consistently annoying from a reader's perspective.</p>

<blockquote>Again, then, they make love, in morning light with cloudy mouths, her tits silky sacs of milk floating shallow on her ridged rib cage.</blockquote>
<p>The second part of this sentence is oddly non-metaphorical.</p>
<p>It's also the first of about 7 million uses of the word "milk" in this book. Steinbeck, I apologize. Your milk wasn't so bad after all.</p>

<blockquote>Because of the baby, they will not go far, just a few blocks maybe to the old gravel quarry, where the ice pond of winter, melted into a lake a few inches deep, doubles the height of the quarry cliff by throwing its rocks upside down into a pit of reflection.</blockquote>
<p>It's these sentences where the prose actively gets in the way of understanding what's being described. Unnecessary confusion.</p>

<blockquote>“Oh that’s right. You think you’re a rabbit.” Her tone in saying this is faintly jeering and irritable, he doesn’t know why.</blockquote>
<p>Maybe because she's reading it Hitler's voice. (Hard not to think of *Jojo Rabbit*, reading this book.)</p>

<blockquote>His car is waiting for him on Cherry Street in the cool spring noon mysteriously; it is as if a room of a house he owned had been detached and scuttled by this curb and now that the tide of night was out stood up glistening in the sand, slightly tilting but unharmed, ready to sail at the turn of a key.</blockquote>
<p>Describing a car being parked in the same place it was last night.</p>

<blockquote>As a shark nudges silent creases of water ahead of it the green fender makes ripples of air that break against the back of Rabbit’s knees. The faster he walks the harder these ripples break.</blockquote>
<p>Another author that doens't understand the concept of <b>sound</b>. It's really the "ripples of air" that's how Rabbit can tell a car's behind him — that's what you think, Updike?</p>

<blockquote>He goes over and tries to tug the mystery from her hand. The title is <i>The Deaths at Oxford</i>. Now what should she care about deaths at Oxford? When she has him here.</blockquote>
<p>"What should she care so much about grapes, of wrath?"</p>

<blockquote>The motion forces a little guttural noise, “cukk,” out of her throat.</blockquote>
<p>Heh heh.</p>

<blockquote><i>What! Your sweet ass!</i></blockquote>
<p>!</p>

<blockquote><i>She stubs stubs fat she stubs the dirt</i> torn open in a rough brown mouth <i>dirt stubs fat</i>: with the woods the “she” is Ruth. Holding a three wood, absorbed in its heavy reddish head and grass-stained face and white stripe prettily along the edge, he thinks <i>O.K. if you’re so smart</i> and clenches and swirls. Ahg: when she tumbled so easily, to balk this!</blockquote>
<p>Dream sequences that really respect the reader's time.</p>

<blockquote>His putt slides past on the down side and goes two or three fucking feet too far. Four feet.</blockquote>
<p>It's an odd but funny choice dropping the book's singular f&#9472;&#9472;&#9472; here, otherwise sticking with "frigging", despite the… rest of the book.</p>

<blockquote>When the first blooms came they were like the single big flower Oriental prostitutes wear on the sides of their heads, on the covers of the paperback spy stories Ruth reads.</blockquote>
<p>That's a good trick actually: end any sentence with "on the covers of the paperback spy stories Ruth reads" for plausible deniability.</p>

<blockquote>Stupid man. A Greek.</blockquote>
<p>Karolides!</p>

<blockquote>“<i>Heh!</i> Eh-HA! Exactly! Exactly!”</blockquote>
<p>!</p>

<blockquote>Ruth wades to the end, through water so shallow the checker pattern of the pool floor is refracted to its surface.</blockquote>
<p>One of those sentences that, once you think about it, you realize means nothing.</p>

<blockquote>The kitten’s instinct to kill the spool with its cotton paws.</blockquote>
<p>This tedious prose could stand to be broken up by a kitten image:</p>

<p>Now was that so hard, Updike?</p>

<blockquote>“About as shy as a snake,” she says, “that girl. These little women are poison.</blockquote>
<p>Snake women return!</p>

<blockquote><i>Du du do do da da dee. Dee dee da da do do du</i>.</blockquote>
<p>Pretty true.</p>

<blockquote>“When on Sunday morning then, when we go before their faces, we must walk up not worn out with misery but full of Christ, <i>hot”</i>—he clenches his hairy fists—“with Christ, on <i>fire: burn </i>them with the force of our belief. That is why they come; why else would they pay us? Anything else we can do or say anyone can do and say.”</blockquote>
<p>The kraut has a point: it's effectively <s>altruism</s> faith.</p>

<blockquote>Unctuous old thundering Hun had no conception of the ministry as a legacy of light and probably himself scrambled into it out of a butcher’s shop.</blockquote>
<p>It's weird: the Buchan novel didn't use the word "Hun" once, and yet here it appears in a far less expected context. Seems backwards.</p>

<blockquote>“…and the other guy says, ‘Stripper, hell. I’ve been in here three weeks looking for my motorcycle!’ ”</blockquote>
<p>How dare you ellipsis off the full joke, Updike.</p>

<blockquote>“What do you think we’re talking about?” He’s too fastidious to mouth the words.

She says.

“Right,” he says.</blockquote>
<p>This ommission is very jarring for how otherwise forward the book is. Weird cultural mix.</p>

<blockquote>“In cold blood.”</blockquote>
<p><book>In Cold Blood|Truman Capote</book>! (Why are there so many standalone book-title sentences?)</p>

<blockquote>Her other hand rests, beside the typewriter, on a string of black beads the size of the necklace of beads carved in Java he once got Janice for Christmas.</blockquote>
<p>The most awkward comparison in a book full of them. The beads are like another set of beads?</p>

<blockquote>The nun seems happy to chat, and both laugh, Eccles in the startled guffaw Rabbit knows well and Sister Bernard with a pure and girlish fat woman’s fluting that springs from her throat slightly retracted, curbed by the frame of stiff frills around her face.</blockquote>
<p>Just another sentence construction example.</p>

<blockquote>He is certain that as a consequence of his sin Janice or the baby will die.</blockquote>
<p>I mean it would be cliche. But it would also make for a shorter book.</p>

<blockquote>On the extreme edge of his tree of fear Eccles perches, black bird, flipping the pages of magazines and making frowning faces to himself.</blockquote>
<p>Kind of lost the metaphor halfway through.</p>
<p><i>Black bird singing in th edead of night,</i></p>
<p><i>Take those broken wings and flip through pages of magazines.</i></p>

<blockquote>He feels underwater, caught in chains of transparent slime, ghosts of the urgent ejaculations he has spat into the mild bodies of women.</blockquote>
<p>The rare, literal use of ejaculation from an older book.</p>

<blockquote>Rabbit laughs, and Lucy, having delivered the Cheerios—too much milk; he is used to living with Ruth, who let him pour his own milk; he likes just enough to take away the dryness, so that the milk and cereal come out even—chats on gaily.</blockquote>
<p>Milk and milk and milk. I agree with Rabbit: too much milk.</p>

<blockquote>“The trouble with you, kid, is you just don’t give a damn.”</blockquote>
<p>…Are you trying to combine two famous movie quotes into one here, Updike?</p>

<blockquote>Rabbit keeps thinking that the M.C., who has that way of a Jew of pronouncing very distinctly, no matter how fast the words, is going to start plugging the MagiPeel Peeler but the product doesn’t seem to have hit the big time yet.</blockquote>
<p>I was getting worried there we'd go through the whole book without at least one.</p>

<blockquote>“You kept me alive, Harry; it’s the truth; you did. All winter I was fighting the grave and then in April I looked out the window and here was this tall young man burning my old stalks and I knew life hadn’t left me. That’s what you have, Harry: life.”</blockquote>
<p>At this point the Rabbit worship ticks up one level too high, and retroactively makes several of Rabbit's previous interactions more annoying.</p>

<blockquote>Funny wise freckled piece he ought to have nailed her that steady high hum bothering him ever since she wanted him to really nail her the shadow of her bra tipped bumps, in a room full of light slips down the shorts over the childish thighs fat butt two globes hanging of white in the light Freud in the white-painted parlor hung with watercolors of canals; come here you primitive father canals on the sofa she sits spreads like two white gates parted—what a nice chest you have and here and here and here.</blockquote>
<p>This is only <b>one-tenth</b> of its paragraph.</p>

<blockquote>And it seems right here that he made the mistaken turning, that he should have followed, and it seems to him in his disintegrating state that he did follow, that he <i>is</i> following, like a musical note that all the while it is being held seems to travel though it stays in the same place. On this note he carries into sleep.</blockquote>
<p>This would have made a fine ending to the book. But no: Updike wants to <i>grind his reader down to dust</i>.</p>

<blockquote>He, too, leaks, thick sweet love burdens his chest, and he wants her—just a touch, he knows she’s a bleeding wound, but just a touch, just enough to get rid of his milk, give it to her.</blockquote>
<p>"His milk".</p>

<blockquote>The smart fabric and cut of the cloth on her shoulders clash with the church yet submit to it; there is something sexed in her stillness in the church, in her obedience to its manly, crusted, rigid procedure.</blockquote>
<p></p>

<blockquote>It has lost the grainy milkiness of morning sun.</blockquote>
<p>I don't even understand this milk use!</p>

<blockquote>“What’s happened to your milk? Why can’t you give the kid enough milk?”</blockquote>
<p>AHH why can't the book be over?</p>

<blockquote>Her sense of the third person with them widens enormously, and she knows, knows, while knocks sound at the door, that the worst thing that has ever happened to any woman in the world has happened to her.</blockquote>
<p>This could also be the ending of the book.</p>
<p><b>No.</b></p>

<blockquote>“Don’t look at <i>me</i>,” he says. “I didn’t kill her.”</blockquote>
<p>So unbelievably awful it wraps around to being funny.</p>


<h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
<p>What an absolutely depressing book.</p>
