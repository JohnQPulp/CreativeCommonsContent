<h4>1. Boston Mercy</h4>
<blockquote>Technical Sergeant Garp, the late gunner whose familiarity with violent death cannot be exaggerated, served with the Eighth Air Force—the air force that bombed the Continent from England.</blockquote>
<p>Ooh, a funny novel set in the Allied air command. This 600-page book wastes no time in breaking new literary ground.</p>

<blockquote>And she found little gimmicks to help her remember their names and their disasters. Thus: Private Jones fell off his bones, Ensign Potter stopped a whopper, Corporal Estes lost his testes, Captain Flynn has no skin, Major Longfellow is short on answers.</blockquote>
<p>The best part about the rhyming of testes with invented character "Estes" (only mention) is that Irving had five examples here. He could have just cut it down to three!</p>

<h4>2. Blood and Blue</h4>
<blockquote>She finished such books promptly, but she had nothing to say about them. In a school community, someone who reads a book for some secretive purpose, other than discussing it, is strange.</blockquote>
<p>Well that depends a lot on what the books are. Maybe she just finished <book>In Dubious Battle</book>, where the conversational entertainment value is as blood from a stone.</p>

<blockquote>“What do you hear the boys call me?” the dean asked.

“‘Mad Dog’?” asked Garp.</blockquote>

<h4>3. What He Wanted to Be When He Grew Up</h4>
<blockquote>“Writers do not read for fun,” Garp would write, later, speaking for himself.</blockquote>
<p>As this book descends further into that always-masturbatory affair of writers writing characters who are also writers, it's good that Irving takes the time out to make sure we know Garp is only speaking for himself here. (Remember: don't ask Irving if the book is autobiographical.)</p>

<blockquote>No score was cited beneath this portrait, but if anyone in the Steering Athletic Department had possessed a sense of humor, Jenny might have read: <small>UNITED STATES</small> 16, <small>GERMANY</small> 1. Sixteen was the number of planes Miles Seabrook shot down before the Germans scored on him.</blockquote>
<p>Discretion is the better part of humor. Not making a joke that needs to be explained afterwards could just as well indicate a refined sense of humor as a lack of one.</p>

<blockquote>She was the brains of the family, he was fond of saying—and she had her mother’s fine looks, which he never mentioned.</blockquote>
<p>Woah woah slow down there Tolstoy. A chick who's smart <b>and</b> good-looking?</p>

<blockquote>“Oh, Jesus,” Garp groaned. “His <i>daughter</i> wrestles?”

“No, she reads a lot,” Jenny said, approvingly.</blockquote>
<p>Oh, Jesus, my mind almost got blown there. Thank God she doesn't actually wrestle. (Though women shouldn't read either.)</p>

<blockquote>“She’s only fifteen, too. And she wears <i>glasses</i>,” she added, hypocritically. After all, she knew what <i>she</i> thought of glasses; maybe Garp liked them, too. “They’re from <i>Iowa</i>,” she added, and felt she was being a more terrible snob than those hated dandies who thrived in the Steering School community.

“God, <i>wrestling</i>,” Garp groaned, again, and Jenny felt relieved that he had passed on from the subject of Helen. Jenny was embarrassed at herself for how much she clearly objected to the possibility. The girl <i>is</i> pretty, she thought—though not in an obvious way; and don’t young boys like only <i>obvious</i> girls? And would I prefer it if Garp were interested in one of those?

As for <i>those</i> kinds of girls, Jenny had her eye on Cushie Percy—a little too saucy with her mouth, a little too slack about her appearance; and should a fifteen-year-old of Cushman Percy’s breeding be so <i>developed</i> already? Then Jenny hated herself for even thinking of the word <i>breeding</i>.</blockquote>
<p>Emphasis <b>not</b> mine. Look Irving, I like that you gave Iowa a shout-out, but could slow down with the damned italics everywhere?</p>

<h4>4. Graduation</h4>
<blockquote>She wore dark green knee socks and a gray flannel skirt, with pleats; often her sweater, always a dark and solid color, matched her knee socks, and always her long dark hair was up, twirled in a braid on top of her head, or complexly pinned. She had a wide mouth with very thin lips and she never wore lipstick.</blockquote>
<p>This character is just Daria Morgendorffer.</p>

<blockquote>When he was at Steering he read Joseph Conrad’s “The Secret Sharer” thirty-four times. He also read D. H. Lawrence’s “The Man Who Loved Islands” twenty-one times; he felt ready to read it again, now.</blockquote>
<p>My favorite part of re-reading short stories is counting the exact number of times I've re-read them.</p>
<p>And while we're doing exact counts: five mentions of Joseph Conrad in this book, always brought up in a gushing way, no matter who the character is. Including not just Garp and his mother and <span class="s">his wife</span> and <span class="s">Ellen James</span>, but also injured student athletes, who I guess find no greater comfort in the hospital than reading <book>Heart of Darkness</book>?</p>
<p>Look Irving, it's fine to have your authors you like to return to, but you've got to vary the mentions. Like I mentioned Tolstoy already, and I do generally like Tolstoy, but I can absolutely still bitch about <book>Father Sergius</book> or the ending of <book>War and Peace</book>.</p>

<h4>5. In the City Where Marcus Aurelius Died</h4>
<blockquote>In truth, Jenny would not have been mistaken for a prostitute by most people, but it is hard to say exactly what she looked like.</blockquote>
<p>Well you're the author, so… (Remember Irving, DUET: Difficult-for-Us/Easy-for-Them.)</p>

<h4>6. The Pension Grillparzer</h4>
<blockquote>Charlotte was the color of the dull ice on the brackish Steering River.</blockquote>
<p>Look Irving, I too have seen the Iowa River in Iowa City. But this description is still not as useful as you think, from my reader's perspective.</p>

<blockquote>She did not tell him that she was referring to Jenny’s book, <i>A Sexual Suspect</i>; it was 1,158 manuscript pages long. Though Helen would later agree with Garp that it was no literary jewel, she had to admit that it was a very compelling story.</blockquote>
<p>I call foul on the book being ~300k words long in the context of how the rest of the plot develops. To the extent that books ever become cultural sensations, it's not from books of that length. It's simply impossible. It's— wait, how long is this book?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Huh, I'll be damned. (Man, there really was nothing better to do in the 70s than <i>read</i>. What a terrible decade.)</p>

<h4>7. More Lust</h4>
<blockquote>“The new fiction is interested in language and in f-f-form, I guess,” Tinch said. “But I don’t understand what it’s really about. Sometimes it’s about it-it-itself, I think,” Tinch said.

“About itself?” Garp said.

“It’s sort of fiction about fi-fi-<i>fic</i>tion,” Tinch told him.</blockquote>
<p>You know what other long-ass book got published in the 70s? <book>Gödel, Escher, Bach</book>. And you are no Hofstadter to me, Irving, so knock it off.</p>

<blockquote>She was taken as the right voice at the right time, but Jenny Fields, sitting whitely in her nurse’s uniform—in the restaurant where John Wolf took only his favorite writers—felt discomfort at the word <i>feminism</i>.</blockquote>
<p>Three appearances or "whitely" as an adverb in this book. Now I'm no Stephen King grouch, but at the same time: really?</p>

<blockquote>She would rise and say, “This is right.” Or, sometimes, “This is wrong”—depending on the occasion. She was the decision maker who’d made the hard choices in her own life and therefore she could be counted on to be on the right side of a woman’s problem.</blockquote>
<p>I love it when books have a character that all the other characters always agree with because they could never be wrong. It's a trope that only appears <i>every other God-damned book</i>. (I guess some credit to Irving for not making that character the protagonist, or his love interest, or the protagonist <b>and</b> his love interest. It's slightly different!)</p>

<blockquote>“Well, there’s a whole <i>society</i> of women now,” Jenny informed him, “because of what happened to Ellen James.”

“What happened to her?” Garp asked.

“Two men raped her when she was eleven years old,” Jenny said. “Then they cut her tongue off so she couldn’t tell anyone who they were or what they looked like. They were so stupid that they didn’t know an eleven-year-old could <i>write.</i> Ellen James wrote a very careful description of the men, and they were caught, and they were tried and convicted. In jail, someone murdered them.”

“Wow,” Garp said. “So <i>that’s</i> Ellen James?” he whispered, indicating the big quiet woman with new respect.

Jenny rolled her eyes again. “No,” she said. “That is someone from the Ellen James <i>Society.</i> Ellen James is still a child; she’s a wispy-looking little blond girl.”

“You mean this Ellen James Society goes around not talking,” Garp said, “as if <i>they</i> didn’t have any tongues?”

“No, I mean they <i>don’t</i> have any tongues,” Jenny said. “People in the Ellen James Society have their tongues cut <i>off.</i> To protest what happened to Ellen James.”

“Oh boy,” Garp said, looking at the large woman with renewed dislike.

“They call themselves Ellen Jamesians,” Jenny said.

“I don’t want to hear any more of this shit, Mom,” Garp said.</blockquote>
<p>Alright so that's terrible. And absurd, and obnoxious, and not remotely in a comedic way. But at least it's over.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>What do you mean it also becomes a major plot point throughout the rest of the 400+ pages still left in this book?</p>
