<h1 id='bloghead' class='center'>About Public Domain Pulp</h1>

Public Domain Pulp is a free, online collection of visual novel transformations of public domain books.

<h2>Free!</h2>



<h2>Open Source!</h2>

<p>Each visual novel on this site has its own corresponding public Github repo. You can clone and build them yourself. Read them offline if you like — they're just static html pages!</p>

<p>Even the website code is open source. (Although the monkey's paw applies: it's written in C#.)</p>

<h2>The Best Prose!</h2>



<h2>Heavy Editorializing!</h2>



<h2>Blog Posts!</h2>

<p>The site also has blog posts. A lot of them also involve me complaining about books' writing.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the rest of this about page is basically a blog post. Read on if you want to learn more about the idea and technical details behind the website:</p>

<h2>The Background</h2>

<p>The Public Domain Pulp site began with a dream to provide free and open-source visual novels to everyone.</p>

<p>Actually it was less of a dream and more of a business idea. And less about providing free visual novels altruistically and more about undercutting the VN market for myself. In any case:</p>

<h2>The Concept</h2>

<p>The situation is that all existing visual novels have terrible prose. Therefore, a visual novel with good or even average prose would be a standout.</p>

<p>At the same time, regular novels are boring, being the inherently least interesting medium. They make up for this by being the best-written medium, but that advantage has only slowed their inevitable and ongoing decline.</p>

<p>However, if we could combine the goodness of books with non-boringness of visual novels, we could have a pareto improvement on both. In some sense, this is just describing the concept of a book adaptation. But where movies and TV shows almost never can retain the original prose of their adapted novels, visual novel "adaptations" can. And it's in this way that they have the opportunity to represent true pareto improvements.</p>

<h2>The Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Getting the good prose is an easily solved problem: I steal it from <a href="https://standardebooks.org/">Standard Ebooks</a>. Not only do they have all the public domain classics — their em dashes are nicely formatted as well.</p>

<p>The "visual" part of the "visual novel" is harder. In fact, it was strictly uneconomical prior to 2025. See, while AI models existed before then, they simply weren't good enough in a number of ways for what a visual novel requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>Hundreds of images — sprites and backgrounds — all drawn in the same style (inconsistency is obvious and distracting).</li>
<li>Sets of variations on the same image (e.g., different sprites for the same character) requiring self-consistency.</li>
<li>Images to all be period- and setting- and description-accurate to both the book as a whole and the particular contexts around individual scenes.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the AI progress was (and still is) continuous, such that 2025 was the tipping point where the models became sufficiently smart and accurate that creating a visual novel out of an existing non-VN became doable.</p>
